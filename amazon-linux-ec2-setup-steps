Login to AWS Console 

Setup Your Amazon Linux EC2 instance

Goto Connect -> SSH -> Copy the ssh command

In your terminal -> cd "folder-that-has-pem-file"

In the Prompt enter "Yes"

If Your Key has not been copied too many times , your instance will get connected 

However,if your key has been copied too many times you have to delete the hostedlist from your system, to do the same in linux or Mac ->

Open terminal -> cd "folder-that-has-pem-file"

->Chmod 400 "key-file.pem"
->ssh-add -K ./key-file.pem
-> now paste the ssh command copied from was console -> instance connected.
